           Company: Royal Family of Qatar<br> </br>
           <br> 
           The Al Thani family has ruled Qatar since the middle of the 19th century. The family's reign has lasted through the founding of modern Qatar, wars, and two coup attempts.
           <br> </br>
           Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani turned Qatar into a major world power during his 18 years in power. (He gained complete power of Qatar by deposing his father in a bloodless coup in 1995. This involved freezing all of his father's assets to prevent any counter-coups.)
           <br> </br>
           The country's natural gas production skyrocketed as a result of mining offshore gas fields and the discovery of untapped oil fields. In 2010, the average income in the country was $86,440 a year per person.
           <br> </br>
           In addition to his income made from oil and gas, Sheikh Hamad invested billions of dollars in businesses, including Volkswagen, Total, Sainsburyâ€™s, and Barclays bank. In 2018, Sheikh Hamad abdicated the throne to his fourth son, Sheikh Tamin bin Hamad al Thani
